    "question": "So comments are basically like Pseudo-Code in the previous video?\nThis kinda confuses me.",
    "answers": ["Good question. A comment is any bit of text that the computer ignores, and it can be used for different things. In the pseudo-code talk-through, I showed how you can write your pseudo-code as comments, and then turn them into real code. (You could also write pseudo-code in a notepad with pencil, which is what some programmers do!) In this talk-through, I show how you can add comments to your code in order to clarify what your code is doing. If you want to combine both techniques, you can start off by planning your program with pseudo-code as comments, and then leave in some of the comments that describe the less obvious parts.", "Pseudo-code (\"fake code\") is something you write for *you*. It has no rules at all. It's not typically shared with anyone else and you might not write it in the same place you write your code. Notice how the author used the \"pen\" tool and sketched off to the side instead of typing into the code window? Think of notes you write on a slip of paper, kind of like scratch paper for a math test. It helps you solve the problem, and then you throw it away. It's written before you start writing code.\n\nComments are both for you and for other people. They go in with your code. There's a rule: you have to write a comment in a way the computer likes it: // or /* ... */. Notice how the author put comments alongside the drawing commands? For example, \"// face\" so you know which ellipse draws the face and which ellipses draw the ears. Comments can be added while you're writing your code (good!) or after it's done.", "Some of nice points are covered in this aerticle: http://www.tutorialsschool.com/c-programming/c-comment.php", "A simple way to explain it is like this: \nPseudo code is for you, prior to writing the program. \nComments are for other programmers (and your future self), _after_ writing the program.\n\nIn other words;\nPseudo code is the blueprint you can use to build.\nComments are the notes you make _during_ building, for you to refer to later.", "Pseudo-code can be written on paper before a project begins. Writing it with // comments here kind of confuses the issue as it looks like you 'need' to include it in the program. You don't. It just helps to gather ideas and create a 'flow' for your program. Using the // comments here means that you don't get annoying error messages. \nMarking others' programs for 'Design a dinner plate,' etc. I have suggested adding // comments so that I/we can tell what has been drawn.", "In batch, we use the REM command, which tells the computer to ignore that line.", "i dont get it why did you get rid of all your fun games we played them and we always did other things then that!"],

In this case you can use comments to tell what they represent, if you feel it's necessary.", "another thing about this is if there are a lot of variables then you might have issues with naming; what i would do is put a comment at the top stating your naming conventions at the beginning and always following that so others can understand your code better.

On the other hand scalars only give you the magnitude, they aren't concerned with direction.", "Speed says only how fast something is going.\n\nVelocity describes, if it moves towards or away from something and how quickly it moves.

Am I wrong?", "Basically, speed is just the measurement of the magnitude of your movement. However, velocity is speed and direction.

There is also multiple ways you could try to get to your final destination from reference point. *In calculus terms SPEED is the ABSOLUTE VALUE of VELOCITY.\n\nNow VELOCITY (also DISPLACEMENT/TIME), has the magnitude but also has a short and static direction, does not mean you can go into the porch and bump into trees from your reference point to your final point. In this case velocity has a straight position that a particle in motion cannot walk in that straight line. That is why everyday motion is mostly a scalar, not much a vector. *In calculus: VELOCITY is the CHANGE of DISPLACEMENT/CHANGE in TIME or simply the SLOPE of a STRAIGHT LINE or VECTOR.\nGood luck understanding! :)", "Velocity has both direction and magnitude whereas speed has magnitude , but, no direction.", "Speed =distance /time{eg :5m /6s}\nVelocity ={Displacement /time}{Eg:5m TO THE RIGHT/6s}", "Speed is a measure of how fast the object is moving.\nVelocity is speed with a direction.\ne.x. 5m/s is the object's speed, 5m/s north is the object's velocity", "You asked 2 years ago, so I'd hope that you have this by now, but for anyone that is still struggling... what helped me to understand the major difference is to define the term velocity...\n\nVelocity is the rate of change of the position of an object\n\nThat is the beginning of the definition. Velocity is a measurement of the rate of change.\n\nSpeed, however, is the magnitude of its velocity.\n\nIt helps in my mind to forget speed all together as being the major depiction of how a thing moves. We are taught speed limits and miles per hour and all these things, but speed is only a fraction of the actual movement.\n\nWhen you are moving, you are doing so in a velocity, and your speed makes up a part of that velocity.\n\nHope this helps. :)"],

(a*t)\n3.3)If the graph isnt straight but is cruvy or uneven then you will have to use integration.\n  this is a bit tricky to solve and this space isnt enough to explain it.\n[NOTE:all the method in point 3),3.1),3.2),3.3) give us the change in velocity.\nto find instantaneous velocity us just have to divide the acc magnitude with the time when it occured]\nhope you liked it . if any mistakes or query inform me about it.", "The easiest way would be to graph a distance over time graph to find the velocity."],

One of them is the fact that, as Sal states, if we weren't given the image and just told the measurement, we wouldn't know its direction.\n\nThe second point, which is mostly an offshoot of the first point, is that you can't exactly say that the measure of the brick's movement is a scalar even with the picture. When you are told that something has moved/changed positions, you intuitively know that it will have traveled in some direction or the other.\n\nThat's what the image shows, and not necessarily the exact direction in which the brick moved. The brick could be moving 5 m in the upwards direction (maybe the board is laid on its side?), or maybe it is moving 5 m to the right (are we considering it from our perspective or the board's perspective?).\n\nThe pictorial representation does show us that the brick has moved in SOME direction with a magnitude of 5 m.

But if his ship accelerates, he can tell, because the laws of physics inside his accelerating ship will be different: he will feel himself thrown against a wall, for example.    And that is a deep question:  why do the laws of physics change in an accelerating reference frame?  We don't have a good answer to that but it is linked to gravity, believe it or not.  Acceleration simulates gravity.  Or should we say that gravity simulates acceleration?  So asking why acceleration has the effect it has is the same as asking why gravity has the effect it has.

You may have noticed that whether the block moves to the left or to the right would not affect how far it travels (i.e. for example, the block can also move '5 meters to the left' or '2 meters to the right'). Thus, magnitude and direction are independent of each other. They can in no way affect each other. \nTherefore, you can say that whenever a physical quantity uses both magnitude and direction to describe, it is a vector quantity.

So, how are your algebra skills?\n\nSometimes unfamiliar names and concepts can be a bit more difficult since we have no experiential background, so the whole thing seems so foreign.\n\nScalars are just numbers, like what you have been using all along. They are called scalars because when you multiply them by something, they scale (make larger or smaller) that something. If I have a 2 and multiply it by 5, I have scaled the 2 up by 5, that is, the 2 is now five times larger, it was 2, now it is 10. If I multiply the 2 by 1/2 now I have made the 2 smaller, it is now half the size of before; it was 2, now it is 1.\n\nA vector, just as the arch-villain in Despicable Me says, \"has both direction and magnitude\". \nThe direction part is just like north east, etc , although there is a way to use numbers to indicate that.\nThe magnitude part is just a number that expresses how fast.

They can be written as \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 where \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f are real and \ud835\udc56\u00b2 = -1. They can be graphed on the complex plane with a vertical imaginary axis with numbers of the form \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 and the horizontal real axis which you are familiar with (you may call this the number line). These are numbers of the form \ud835\udc4e. Thus, \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 can be graphed with a horizontal coordinate of \ud835\udc4e and a vertical coordinate of \ud835\udc4f similar to the normal Cartesian plane.\n\nNow we recall that for _real numbers_, the concept of absolute value is nothing more than the _distance_ between the given number and 0 on the number line. A similar definition follows for complex numbers. The absolute value of a complex number (actually sometimes called the _magnitude_ of the complex number) is simply the distance between the complex number and the origin (which represents 0) in the complex plane. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can see that this will always be \u221a(\ud835\udc4e\u00b2 + \ud835\udc4f\u00b2). That is, for any complex number \ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56, we have:\n\n|\ud835\udc67| = \u221a(\ud835\udc4e\u00b2 + \ud835\udc4f\u00b2)\n\nThat being said, you can define vectors using complex numbers. In particular, you can choose the origin of the complex plane to be the starting point of the vector, and you can make the \"arrow\" travel all the way out to a certain complex number graphed in the complex plane. Then, the magnitude (or length) of this vector is nothing but the magnitude (or absolute value) of the complex number that defines it! The two concepts are therefore deeply related. In fact, you can view them as the _same_ concept, just under two different interpretations. One interpretation is the absolute value of a complex number, and the other is the magnitude (or _norm_) of a vector. In fact, as I mentioned before, when talking about complex numbers, \"absolute value\" is interchangeable with \"magnitude\". However, the word \"norm\" is usually reserved for just vectors and \"absolute value\" is reserved for complex numbers as well.\n\nComment if you have questions!"],

    "question": "Is time a scalar or a vector quantity? Sal mentioned it is either a scalar or vector as it can only move in one direction.",
    "answers": ["For most intents and purposes, time is a scalar quantity, because you are only interested in the magnitude. The direction that you see time move (eggs break, but don't randomly reform) is a result of something called entropy, which creates what you perceive to be the arrow of time. Nevertheless, it is still a scalar quantity.\n\nYou have to be careful, though, in how you define the word \"time\". On many occasions, people usually seem to be referring to a time interval, which is particularly important when you start dealing with high level physics like relativity, where time is usually combined with space (and thus, called space-time). In those scenarios, time intervals will be considered a vector quantity, because it will end up linking two different points in space-time together, and thus, direction is also important."],

    "answers": ["I think there are a couple of reasons time is not usually treated as a vector quantity. First, while its pretty obvious time does have a direction, it is more of an intangible direction than a physical one. Time will be positive in all but a few specialized physics problems. But that doesn't necessarily give it vector status any more than distance, which is always a positive number.                ( While you can have displacement of -2 miles, the distance is just 2 miles). \nThere will always be a debate on the subject, but is kind of moot. A scaler quantity of time will solve problems just as well as time as vector would. It is just assumed that change in time is always going to be positive. \nMost of this is my opinion, and not something I read in an official math rule book, so take it for what its worth."],

Some of these languages can be hard to learn, but _after_ you learn HTML, you can check some of them out, like PHP, Ruby and Java (with which you can use an HTML-like scripting framework called Java Server Pages, or JSP)."],

    "answers": ["JavaScript looks like it will not be going out of fashion soon. The security issues I know of are preventable. Here are some things to keep in mind to write secure JavaScript:\n- Never assume your users are trustworthy.\n- Know that your users can view and edit your JavaScript code in their browsers, so don't depend on it to do things like verify passwords and validate input.\n- If you accept data from one user, keep in mind that it could be malicious code and never use it on other users' pages without sanitizing/escaping it (making sure it won't be run as code by their browsers.)", "JavaScript is ultimately the language of the internet, and is going nowhere anytime soon.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if something needs to be secured (passwords, credit card information, etc.), you will not be using JavaScript to do so. There are many back end languages that will handle that.\n\nBack end means code that runs on the server before information is sent over the internet to your browser, btw.

    "answers": ["They all work together.  HTML is the webpage's structure and is stored in a `.html` file.  CSS, what styles the page, can be either put in a `<style>` tag of that HTML document or linked (using the `<link>` tag) into the HTML file from a separate CSS file.  JavaScript makes the page interactive an can be either embedded into the HTML via the `<script>` tag or imported in from a separate file also through the `<script>` tag (`<script src = \"myjsfile.js\"></script>`).\n\nYou will learn how to work with HTML and CSS in this course.  Once you are done, you can learn how to integrate JavaScript into your pages in this course: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js", "Keep going through the lessons to find out how. They start with plain HTML, but as you continue CSS is incorporated. The tutorial HTML/JS incorporates JavaScipt once you've got the HTML and CSS basics down so that you can create interactive webpages. Happy coding!"],

    "question": "why does the atomic weight differ from one periodic table to another?",
    "answers": ["First, \"atomic weight\" is an old and obsolete term that really should not be used (though, unfortunately, quite a few people, including professionals who should know better, continue to use it). The proper term is \"standard relative atomic mass\" which is usually shortened to \"standard atomic mass\".\n \nThere are four main reasons the values of standard atomic masses vary on periodic tables:\n1. The standard values are based on averages of atomic masses as they are found throughout the world. From time to time, additional data require adjusting the standard values. For example, if a new chromium mine were found and its isotopes were in slightly different abundances than elsewhere, that would have to be factored into the calculations for the standard value and there would be an adjustment to the standard value. Thus, older tables might have somewhat different standard atomic masses than current ones.\n \n2. Some elements have standard atomic masses known to more digits than others. But this creates problems because if you are adding up the standard molecular mass for a compound and know some elements' atomic masses to 7 digits and others to only 4, then you would have to round off the digits of the elements you know more precisely. Thus, periodic tables round off some of the better known standard atomic masses to different numbers of significant digits.  To address this problem, IUPAC (_that is the international chemistry society in charge of the official periodic table_) decided in 2011 to standardize rounding off to 4 significant digits. Thus, tables produced after that date will have at most 4 significant digits whereas periodic tables before that date will have a variety of numbers of significant digits.\n  \n3. There are several elements whose atomic masses vary too much for a standard atomic mass to be legitimately assigned to four significant digits. Some periodic tables address this by reporting those elements to 3 significant digits. Other just use older, less justifiable, values with more digits. IUPAC has addressed this problem by listing those elements that vary too much as having a range of standard atomic masses rather than a single value. Those elements are H, Li B, C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Cl, Br and Tl.\n \n4. For various reasons, there are some of the radioactive elements that cannot reasonably have a standard atomic mass assigned to them (I can explain that if you like). Thus, IUPAC recently dropped having ANY standard atomic mass for those elements. So, in modern periodic tables some elements do not have a listed standard atomic mass. But, in older tables you will find all sorts of values for those elements.", "The atomic number of an atom is based upon the number of protons (and electrons). A stable (neutral) atom will always have the same number of protons and electrons. The atomic weight is the combination of both protons and neutrons.", "every elements differ from one same element. if we see the water is formed because it has hydrogen and oxygen. so atomic weight changed.", "first of all it is atomic mass. and each element has different number of protons, neutrons and electrons, therefore the mass is different"],

    "question": "Can someone explain the amu to me please?  What does it mean and how is it used to find other values such as molar mass and the mass of a molecule?",
    "answers": ["An amu (_for which chemists use the symbol u or Da_) is 1/12 the mass of one atom of carbon-12. As such, it is close to, but not the same as, the mass of either a proton or a neutron. The amu is equal to about 1.6605389\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2074 grams.\n \nThe standard relative atomic mass of the elements appears on the periodic table (_a lot of people call this number the \"atomic weight\" but that is an old and obsolete term you should avoid_). Most of the time, chemists call the standard relative atomic mass just the \"atomic mass\" unless they need to be more precise about what they mean.\n\nThe atomic mass can be expressed in units of u (or amu). This is the average mass of an atom of that element (the actual mass varies because of isotopes, so the value on the periodic table takes that into account). To get the average mass of a molecule, you add up the atomic masses of every atom in the molecule (and if there is more than one atom of a particular element, be sure to add the atomic mass of that element however many times as there are atoms of that element in the molecule).\n \nAs for the molar mass, here is a link to an answer I posted a while back about this.  This is an alternative way of explaining a mole and Avogadro's constant that I hope will make this more clear\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/chemical-reactions-stoichiome/empirical-molecular-formula/v/the-mole-and-avogadro-s-number?qa_expand_key=ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXJkCxIIVXNlckRhdGEiQXVzZXJfaWRfa2V5X2h0dHA6Ly9nb29nbGVpZC5raGFuYWNhZGVteS5vcmcvMTE3NTA0NDU4NTg1NTkyNjgyMTA1DAsSCEZlZWRiYWNrGICAgKDQsaEKDA", "The unified atomic mass unit or dalton is a standard unit of mass that quantifies mass on an atomic or molecular scale.

    "question": "When I measure something on scales, it tells me the object's \"weight\" in kilograms . If weight is not measured in kilograms, does that mean that the scales are actually calculating the mass of the object?",
    "answers": ["Yup! Scales are calculating the mass of the object, but in everyday terms we usually call it weight. As if all the definitions weren't confusing enough!", "This is a very good question which is more complicated that it first appears. It depends on whether the scales are the spring-type or the balance-arm type.\nSpring-type scales give a readout in kg (mass) but are actually measuring weight, which is a force defined in Newtons (N). The scales convert the measured force into mass by dividing the force by the acceleration due to gravity on earth - this is done automatically and is built in by the manufacturer of the scales. What this means is that if you took your scales to the moon and weighed yourself there the reading on the scales in kg would be lower than on earth - however, this would be wrong because your mass in kg is the same on earth as it is on the moon, but your weight is lower on the moon. The scales would need to be recalibrated for use on the moon by taking into account the lower acceleration due to gravity on the moon.\nFor balance-arm scales (where you have pans suspended either side of a beam that pivots), you are directly comparing mass in one pan against another mass in the other pan. If you took one of these devices to the moon, along with a set of \"weights\", it would give you your correct mass in kg. No adjustment would be needed for acceleration due to gravity."],

    "question": "May someone please explain what atomic weight is? I'm extremely confused.",
    "answers": ["Atomic weight is nowadays officially called \"relative atomic mass\" but a lot of scientists still refer to atomic weight.\n\nAtomic weight takes into account the relative abundance of the naturally occurring isotopes of an element found on earth. This is done by taking samples from lots of places and analysing their isotopic compositions.  \n\nTo take an example, lithium has two isotopes that are found on earth - lithium-6 and lithium-7.  Each of these as an atomic mass, which is 6.015122 for lithium-6 and 7.016004 for lithium-7. (Atomic mass means the mass of a _specific_ isotope, expressed in atomic mass units.)                  \n\nMost lithium is found as lithium-7 (92.41%) and the rest as lithium-6 (7.59%).\n\nTo calculate atomic weight, we take a _weighted average_, which takes into account atomic mass and relative abundance.\n\nSo the atomic weight of lithium is:   (6.015122 x 0.0759) + (7.016004 x 0.9241) = 6.940037\n\nNotice that the calculated atomic weight is a little less than the atomic mass of the major isotope, lithium-7. This is what you expect for a weighted average because lithium-6 doesn't contribute much.\n\nIf you look in a periodic table, the atomic weight of lithium is usually given as 6.94.\n\nWhen you are doing calculations in chemistry you will almost always use atomic weights, rather than atomic masses. This is because a bottle of (say) lithium chloride will contain both the isotopes of lithium, not just one of the isotopes."],

    "question": "What is the atomic weight? I still don't get it.",
    "answers": ["Atomic weight is a _weighted average_ of the atomic masses which takes into account the relative abundances of the isotopes of the element.\n\nThis is best illustrated with an example. Two isotopes of boron are found on earth - boron-10 and boron-11 (each containing 5 protons, but with 5 and 6 neutrons, respectively). These are found on earth in percentages of 19.9 and 80.1, respectively. Boron-10 has an atomic mass of 10.012937 and boron-11 an atomic mass of 11.009305.\n\nThe atomic weight of boron is the weighted average of these two isotopes. This is calculated as follows: (10.012937 * 0.199) + (11.009305 * 0.801) = 10.81102. If you look up the atomic weight of boron in a periodic table you will see that it agrees with this value.\n\n(Note that the term atomic weight is outdated. The term that should now be used in its place is _relative atomic mass_. Nevertheless, many professional chemists still refer to atomic weight because it takes a long time for old habits to change.)", "https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/introduction-to-the-atom/v/atomic-weight-calculation"],

    "answers": ["Can you hack 123thethe123?", "Actually any type of scale by definition measures weight. It is important here to understand the difference between weight and mass: mass is the amount of matter in an object, matter being any physical  thing that takes up space. Weight is the force of gravity that acts on mass. Because the strength of gravity on earth is constant (9.8m/s^2), the words weight and mass are often used synonymously even thought they mean slightly different things.\nThis means for example, if I went to the moon, where gravity is weaker, my mass would not change but my weight would be different because there's less force acting on my mass.\nBecause gravity on Earth is constant, we can use scales that measure weight to find mass, because we know x kgs of mass always weigh the same on Earth.", "Depends on what kind of scale.

    "answers": ["Another way to consider it is that the \"average\" atom of Carbon found on Earth weighs 12.011 AMU, but there are some heavier and lighter isotopes that do exist. \n\nHere's an example: the average family in the US has 1.87 children per family. There obviously isn't such a thing as having 0.87 children. It's just a weighted average of the total population. Just like there are some families that may have as many as 8 children, they do not contribute much to the average because they are so few compared to the families who have 2 children. \n\nIn the same way, there are other individual atoms of Carbon that have more neutrons, called isotopes, giving them higher masses. However, they are less common and don't move the average around very much. What's interesting is that the AMU numbers listed on the periodic table only apply to elements found on Earth.

The only difference between atomic mass and atomic weight is that atomic mass is the mass of a specific isotope of an element and atomic weight is the weighted average of the atomic masses of all the isotopes of that element that are found on earth.\n\nLithium, for example, has naturally-occurring two isotopes which are Li-6 (3 protons and 3 neutrons) and Li-7 (3 protons and 4 neutrons) - these have atomic masses of 6.015122 amu and 7.016004 amu, respectively. However, the atomic _weight_ of lithium (the number you see in the periodic table) is 6.94 amu - this is because lithium found in nature is 7.59% Li-6 and 92.41% Li-7. So if you take a weighted average of the atomic masses, you get 6.94.  \n\nWhat this boils down to is that the word \"weight\", as used in atomic weight, means a _weighted average_ and not a force.

A british chemist who studied radioactive elements, Frederick Soddy, theorized that there can be particles that behave like a certain element, but have different atomic weights. \nThe mass spectrograph is a method/instrument that was discovered in 1919 by Francis William Aston, who then used the device to prove the existence of isotopes. (this was still before the discovery of the neutron). \nThe neutron was then discovered in 1935 by studying the particles emitted when beryllium metal was hit with the radioactive decay of plutonium. Scientists found that some of those particles could displace protons in another sample of metal, but weren't affected by a magnet. This proved the existence of the neutron, as a neutrally-charged particle that has the same mass as a proton. \nSo, to get to your question, in the \"old\" days (early 1900s), scientists used the physics and radioactive elements to discover neutrons and isotopes. However, these discoveries were proved with the method of spectrometry. Today, the mass of elements and molecules are still determined with a mass spectrometer. \n\nDiscovery of neutron:\nhttp://dev.physicslab.org/Document.aspx?doctype=3&filename=AtomicNuclear_ChadwickNeutron.xml\nHow a Mass spectrometer works:\nhttp://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/masspec/howitworks.html", "You can determine the mass number of an element by using a mass spectrometer.\nSince you know the element and its atomic number, the difference must be the number of neutrons."],

    "answers": ["you could, but people might think you are graphing two different things(as in data) instead of just one.\n\n               like Isabella.hugley said up there, you could also do fractions, but it could also make people think that you are measuring something that involves fractions, but it would help, and most people would understand.\n                you could split the picture in half, like what Ic306578 said, but it would only get you half of a number. So say you have cats = 8. You have one part of the graph that only needs 6. you can't take half and say that you're done, because that's 4 cats, not 6.\n                 this is why, usually, you would try to find a number that is divisible by all the numbers you have to record. Sorta like finding a GCF of all of the numbers you need to represent. So, you have the numbers 48, 56, 16, and 8 and you want to put them all in a graph. You don't want to do fractions, so how would you do it? Well, you could do 2. But a bigger number you could use would be 8.\n                               So there's a few ways to do it. I hope it's not too confusing too understand(as in, what I just explained). And I hope this answer helped you. Good luck on your math journey!", "put have of what there is if there is 6 and a half drop you put 3 hope that helps ;)", "o- and o+ so 5 people have -5 blood type i am not sure if it was o a or b", "a pictograph is to measure quickly. yes you could, but it is uncommon to do so", "Usually in pictographs, people just draw a fraction of a picture instead of different kinds of pictures. So if there was half a drop, it would be half of the number that each picture represents ( Ex.: A picture of a cat = 4 cats. A picture of half a cat = 2 cats ).\n\nI hope this actually made sense to you! :)"],

This means that whatever we multiply 28 by to get 119, we would also multiply 1 by to get n. We need to figure out, we will call it x, in the problem 29 times x = 119. To find the missing factor, we can divide the product by one of the known factors.
